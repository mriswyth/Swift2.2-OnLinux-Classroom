# A Classroom for Swift 2.2 on Linux
Classroom experiments for exploring Swift 2.2 programming on Linux

This project will contain multiple classroom expirments as I try to get familiar with Swift 2.2 running on Linux and how it differs from programming Swift on iOS/OSX in Xcode.

My Linux Swift environment consists of Gentoo hosting an Ubuntu 15.10 Docker container with the Swift 2.2 Release package installed.
